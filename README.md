#About
* I created an authentication module so multiple users could use the service and track their urls 
* The url shortening service stores the original url and generate another url using the key given by the user or it generates a random string of 6 small letters on its own if the key field is left blank
* There are multiple way to create the key on its own like creating a unique hash_id or hex value of the original url. I used a random string generator as it created fairly unique strings and is easier to check incase of duplicate URLs and also it is easier to control the length of the generated string
